# HackyTool
### HackyTool It is a tool to make it easier for you to install some of the famous Linux utilities. The method is designed for Linux, not Windows. You have to install Linux on Windows through WSL, and it is the method that I prefer! Or use VMW or VBOx!

## installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Fekerineamar/HackyTool.git
```

```
cd HackyTool
```

```
sudo chmod +x linux.sh
```

```
./linux.sh 
```

Thank You for use it!
Follow me for new tool in future!
